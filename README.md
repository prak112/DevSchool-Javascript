The following fundamental programming concepts are learned and implemented through this Role Playing Game:
- Arrays, 
- Strings & related operations,
- Objects, 
- Functions, 
- Loops, 
- Selection statements - if/else, etc.

# Gameplay
<p>
Game starts with the player at the Townsquare. He has 3 options to choose on what to do next.
After choosing either options, the player enters that specific environment
</p>

- If Player Wins :
    - There is a 50% probability that they might enter a Lottery round for XP, Gold and Health
    - Also, there is an unassigned random probability of the Player to lose all the Gold and 50 Health. Oopsie!

- If Player Loses :
    - The player has the possibility to restart the game from the beginning.

Goodluck out there, Dragon-Repeller!
